This resolution should be passed by the community because of the reasons that this delegate is going to talk about. First, the delegatesâ€™ resolution supports the ban of firearms, which is helpful for the international community, because firearms are creating mass destructions along with numerous casualties of innocent people. These firearms are created by companies that mass produce guns. These solutions all base on the vital responsibility of countries to educate the young generation about the dangers and harms of gun violence. Gun violence may also intentionally be used in different focuses, and this may include domestic violence. Domestic violence also is a current issue, harming citizens especially women by assaulting and raping. Our resolution also further effectively block domestic violence by giving harsher punishments and elongating the imprisonment period or providing tolerance to domestic violence criminals, but most significantly promoting organizations where women can eagerly reach out help whenever domestic violence occurs.
